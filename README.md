# Hello World! 👋

I am Marcia Villalba, a software engineer 👩‍💻 from Uruguay 🇺🇾 living in Helsinki 🇫🇮. I have been working for almost 20 years in the IT industry, doing all kind of things related to software development. I am part of the 1% of hispanic women in computer science, a minority in the minorities.

Nowadays I work as an AWS Developer Advocate, helping developers bring their ideas to life in the cloud.
